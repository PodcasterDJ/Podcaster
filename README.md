### Introduction

This is Public Repository with a simple Podcast/Blog application written in Django 2. The basic look is based on [free ColorLib podcasts template][0]. How it looks after deploy and customisation can be seen [here][1].

### Things you should know üí°

Because of Heroku's [file storage policies][2] this App uses [AWS S3][3] to store files like Photos and Audio. By default the button you see on the top uses paid heroku Add-on [Bucketeer][4] that costs 5$ per month and is billed on your heroku account.

In order to avoid paying for Heroku Add-on you can use your own AWS S3 bucket with [__FREE__][5] tier. If you don't have or don't know how to get needed credentials for your bucket [check this tutorial][6].

If you want to deploy your app __100% FREE__ you can use button on [no-addons-free-deploy][7] branch, that will generate you the deploy without bucketeer.

__IMPORTANT!__:
> During deploy admin account is created automatically with the following credentials: login __admin__ / pass __StarIfUsefulThanks!__. Don't forget to change the admin password after first login!

### What is my goal?

The goal is to teach people Django and practice together via Pull Requests, pair programing and having fun. Expand functionalities by learning _Django Rest Framework_ and increase the customisation options. Implement good practices, new functionalities and more.
